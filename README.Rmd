####1.  Generate a plot that contains the different pch symbols. Investigate the knitr code chunk options to see whether you can have a pdf version of the image produced so you can print it off for yoru reference. It should look like this:

    <img src="pch.png", style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="500">


```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align= "center"}
symbol <- c(1:25)
y <- rep(1, 25)
plot(symbol, y, type = "n", xlab = "PCH value", xlim=c(0,25), frame = F, yaxt = "n", xaxt="n", ylab="", main="PCH Symbols")
axis(side=1, at=1:25)# abs=c(seq(1, 25, 2))side = 1, 1:25
     #lab=c("1", "", "3", "", "5", "", "7", "", "9", "", "11", "", "13", "", "15", "", "17", "", "19", "", "21", "", "23", "", "25")) 
abline(v=seq(1:25), b=0, col = "gray")
points(symbol,y, pch = c(1:25), cex=2)
```

####2.  Using the `germfree.nmds.axes` data file available in this respositry, generate a plot that looks like this. The points are connected in the order they were sampled with the circle representing the beginning ad the square the end of the time course:

    <img src="beta.png", style="margin:0px auto;display:block" width="700">


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=7.5, fig.align= "center"}
germfree <- read.table(file = "germfree.nmds.axes", header = T)

#First, let's subset the data by mouse
mouse337 <- subset(germfree, mouse == "337")
mouse343 <- subset(germfree, mouse == "343")
mouse361 <- subset(germfree, mouse == "361")
mouse387 <- subset(germfree, mouse == "387")
mouse389 <- subset(germfree, mouse == "389")

par(font=2, family = "Helvetica") # bold legend
plot(germfree$axis1, germfree$axis2, type = "n", xlab = "NMDS Axis 1", ylab = "NMDS Axis 2", font=2, font.lab=2) #bolded axes

#Draw lines of the timecourse for each mouse through NMDS space
points(mouse337$axis1, mouse337$axis2, type="l", col="black", lwd=2)
points(mouse343$axis1, mouse343$axis2, type="l", col="blue", lwd=2)
points(mouse361$axis1, mouse361$axis2, type="l", col="red", lwd=2)
points(mouse387$axis1, mouse387$axis2, type="l", col="green", lwd=2)
points(mouse389$axis1, mouse389$axis2, type="l", col="darkred", lwd=2)

#Time to add the circles to represent the beginning of the time course
points(mouse337$axis1[1], mouse337$axis2[1], type = "p", col = "black", pch=19, cex=2)
points(mouse361$axis1[1], mouse361$axis2[1], type = "p", col = "red", pch=19, cex=2)
points(mouse343$axis1[1], mouse343$axis2[1], type = "p", col = "blue", pch=19, cex=2)
points(mouse387$axis1[1], mouse387$axis2[1], type = "p", col = "green", pch=19, cex=2)
points(mouse389$axis1[1], mouse389$axis2[1], type = "p", col = "darkred", pch=19, cex=2)

#Add squares to represent the end of the time course
points(mouse337$axis1[20], mouse337$axis2[20], type = "p", col = "black", pch=15, cex=2)
points(mouse343$axis1[21], mouse343$axis2[21], type = "p", col = "blue", pch=15, cex=2)
points(mouse361$axis1[20], mouse361$axis2[20], type = "p", col = "red", pch=15, cex=2)
points(mouse387$axis1[21], mouse387$axis2[21], type = "p", col = "green", pch=15, cex=2)
points(mouse389$axis1[21], mouse389$axis2[21], type = "p", col = "darkred", pch=15, cex=2)

#Finally, let's add the legend
legend(x=-0.02, y=-0.18, 
       legend=c("Mouse 337", "Mouse 343", "Mouse 361", "Mouse 387", "Mouse 389"), 
       col=c("black", "blue", "red", "green", "darkred"), lty=1, lwd=4)
```



####3.  On pg. 57 there is a formula for the probability of making x observations after n trials when there is a probability p of the observation.  For this exercise, assume x=2, n=10, and p=0.5.  Using R, calculate the probability of x using this formula and the appropriate built in function. Compare it to the results we obtained in class when discussing the sex ratios of mice.



```{r}
n_trials <- 10
prob <- 0.5
x_observ <- 2
woot <- dbinom(x = x_observ, size = n_trials, prob = prob)
hist(woot, breaks = seq(-0.5, 10.5, 1))
percent <- woot*100
```

*Here, we performed 10 breedings of mice but only observed 2 of the breedings.  The probability of getting a male mouse versus a female mouse was 50/50.  This calculation was the same as what we did in class, with a point probability of `r woot`.  This means that `r percent`% of the time we will get either 2 females or 2 males from our 2 observations.*


####4.  On pg. 59 there is a formula for the probability of observing a value, x, when there is a mean, mu, and standard deviation, sigma.  For this exercise, assume x=10.3, mu=5, and sigma=3.  Using R, calculate the probability of x using this formula and the appropriate built in function


```{r}
x_observ <- 10.3
st_dev <- 5
mean <- 3



```


####5.  One of my previous students, Joe Zackular, obtained stool samples from 89 people that underwent colonoscopies.  30 of these individuals had no signs of disease, 30 had non-cancerous ademonas, and 29 had cancer.  It was previously suggested that the bacterium *Fusobacterium nucleatum* was associated with cancer.  In these three pools of subjects, Joe determined that 4, 1, and 14 individuals harbored *F. nucleatum*, respectively. Create a matrix table to represent the number of individuals with and without _F. nucleatum_ as a function of disease state.  Then do the following:

```{r}
#Make a Matrix with data
Group <-  c("NoDisease", "Ademonas", "Cancer")
Num_People <- c(30, 30, 29)
Nucleatum_Abund <- c(4, 1, 14)
nuc <- data.frame(Group, Num_People, Nucleatum_Abund)
rownames(nuc) <- nuc$Group
nuc$Group = NULL
data.matrix(nuc, rownames.force = T)
```

####      * Run the three tests of proportions you learned about in class using built in R functions to the 2x2 study design where normals and adenomas are pooled and compared to carcinomas.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Generate new matrix
Group <-  c("Healthy", "Cancer")
with_nuc <- c(5, 14)
total<- c(60, 29)
non_cancer <- data.frame(Group, with_nuc, total)
rownames(non_cancer) <- non_cancer$Group
non_cancer$Group = NULL
```
**1.  Test of proportions**:  Give two vectors where the first contains the number of positive outcomes and the second the total number for each group  
  +  **Null Hypothesis:** The proportion of healthy individuals with _F. nucleatum_ is the same as the proportion of cancerous individuals with *F. nucleatum.* 
  +  **Alternative Hypothesis:**  The proportion of healthy individuals with _F. nucleatum_ is **not the same** as the proportion of cancerous individuals with *F. nucleatum.* 
```{r}
#Test of proportions
with_nuc <- c(5,14) #Successes
total <- c(60,29) #Totals
nuc_proptest <- prop.test(with_nuc, total)
```
**With a test of proportions, we get a p-value of `r nuc_proptest$p.value`, which tells us that our null hypothesis is rejected.  Thus, there is a significant difference between the proportion of healthy individuals with _F. nucleatum_ and the proportion of cancerous individuals with _F. nucleatum_.**

***  

**2.  Fisher's Exact Test**:  Requires data to be in matrix form (2X2) where the first column is the number of successes and the second column is the number of failures. (Success = With _F. nucleatum_, Failure = Without _F. nucleatum_)  
  +  **Null Hypothesis:** Cancer **does not** affect the presence of _F. nucleatum_ in people.  
  +  **Alternative Hypothesis:**  Cancer **does** affect the presence of _F. nucleatum_ in people.
```{r}
#Fisher's Exact Test
nuc <- matrix(c(5, 14, 55,15), 2)
nuc_fishertest <- fisher.test(nuc)
```
**With Fisher's exact test, we get a p-value of `r nuc_fishertest$p.value`, which tells us that our null hypothesis is rejected.  So, cancer does affect the presence of _F. nucleatum_ in people.**  

***

**3.  Binomial Test**:  Requires data to be in matrix form (2X2) where the first column is the number of successes and the second column is the number of failures. (Success = With _F. nucleatum_, Failure = Without _F. nucleatum_)  
  +  **Null Hypothesis:** The probability of  _F. nucleatum_ presence in healthy people/people with cancer is **less than 0.5.**    
  +  **Alternative Hypothesis:**  The probability of _F. nucleatum_ presence in healthy people/people with cancer is **more than 0.5.**    
```{r}
#Binomial test
cancer_binom <- binom.test(14, 15, 0.5, alternative ="greater")
healthy_binom <- binom.test(5, 55, 0.5, alternative = "greater")
```
**With a binomial test, we get a p-value of `r cancer_binom$p.value`, for individuals with cancer which tells us that our null hypothesis is rejected.  So, The probability of _F. nucleatum_ presence in people with cancer is more than 0.5.  For healthy individuals, we get a p-value of `r healthy_binom$p.value`, which accepts our null hypothesis.  So, the probability of _F. nucleatum_ presence in people with cancer is less than 0.5**  


####      * Without using the built in chi-squared test function, replicate the 2x2 study design in the last problem for the Chi-Squared Test...
```{r}
#ChiSquared Test
chisq.test(non_cancer)

```    
**Chi-squared test: Test for association between two factors. 
  **Null Hypothesis:** There is no association between cancer and F. nucleatum presence.
  **Alternative Hypothesis:**  There is an association between the two factors


####      * Calculate the expected count matrix and calculate the Chi-Squared test statistics. Figure out how to get your test statistic to match Rs default statistic.
```{r}
```   

####      *	Generate a Chi-Squared distributions with approporiate degrees of freedom by the method that was discussed in class (hint: you may consider using the `replicate` command)
```{r}
```      

####      * Compare your Chi-Squared distributions to what you might get from the appropriate built in R functions
```{r}
```      

####      * Based on your distribution calculate p-values
```{r}
```      

####      * How does your p-value compare to what you saw using the built in functions? Explain your observations.
```{r}
```      


####6.  Get a bag of Skittles or M&Ms.  Are the candies evenly distributed amongst the different colors?  Justify your conclusion.

```{r}


mms <- c(9, 13, 6, 11, 8, 10)
names(mms) <- c("Green", "Orange", "Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Brown")

hist(mms)

```
